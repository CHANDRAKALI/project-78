    <h3>Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. 
    It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured 
    IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.</h3>

    <h4>An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode.
        The Visual Studio IDE (integrated development environment) is a software program for developers to write and edit their code. 
        Its user interface is used for software development to edit, debug and build code.
        To print a message to the console, we use the WriteLine() method of the Console class.
